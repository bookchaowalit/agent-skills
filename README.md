# Solo Empire Skills

This folder contains portable AI skill packages for work performed in this
repository. A skill is a directory with a required `SKILL.md`; it may also
include `agents/openai.yaml`, `scripts/`, `references/`, or `assets/` when they
are genuinely needed.

## Use

1. Find the skill whose `SKILL.md` description matches the task.
2. Read that skill's `SKILL.md` before acting on the task.
3. Load linked references only when the workflow needs them.
4. Run bundled scripts from the skill directory and verify their output.
5. Keep secrets, personal data, generated output, and provider-local state out
   of the skill package.

Copy `skills/skill-template/` when creating a new skill. Skill names use
lowercase letters, digits, and hyphens. Keep the body concise and put trigger
conditions in frontmatter.

These are repository-owned, provider-neutral instructions. `.claude/`,
`.qoder/`, `.codex/`, and other dot-directories remain provider discovery and
runtime boundaries; do not move them here.
